# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository! ðŸš€ This repository contains all my Machine Learning (ML) projects, including their respective datasets. As I continue learning new concepts and techniques, I will keep updating this repository with new projects and improvements.

## ðŸ“Œ What's Inside?

- Various ML projects covering different domains.
- Datasets used for training and testing models.
- Step-by-step explanations and code implementations.
- Continuous updates as I learn and explore more.

## ðŸ”§ How to Use

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/wali321/ML-projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder: 
   ```sh
   cd ml-projects/project-name
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the respective README files inside each project folder.
