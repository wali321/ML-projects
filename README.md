# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains all my Machine Learning (ML) projects, including their respective datasets. As I continue learning new concepts and techniques, I will keep updating this repository with new projects and improvements.

## ðŸ“Œ What's Inside?
- Various ML projects covering different domains.
- Datasets used for training and testing models.
- Step-by-step explanations and code implementations.
- Continuous updates as I learn and explore more.

## ðŸ”§ How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd ml-projects/project-name
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in the respective README files inside each project folder.

## ðŸ“‚ Project List
| Project Name | Description | Dataset |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| first model using decison tree | House price prediction  using descision trees | 'first model using decison tree/melb_data.csv' |
| Random Forest  | Practicing Random Forest   | 'random forest/melb_data.csv' |
| mean absolute error  | Practicing Mean absolute error   | 'mean absolute error/melb_data.csv' |
| Car Price prediction | Predicting car prices using both random forest and decision trees   | 'car price prediction using descision tree and random forest/carprice.csv' |
| More... | More projects coming soon! | - |

## ðŸš€ Upcoming Updates
- New projects as I learn new ML concepts.
- Dataset additions and enhancements.
- Code optimizations and improvements.
